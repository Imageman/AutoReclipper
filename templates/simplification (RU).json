Read the following complex scientific text carefully—including any formulas or technical terms—and rewrite it in simplified Russian that would be understandable to a university or college student with basic subject knowledge.

If formulas are present, briefly explain what they mean in plain language. Return only the simplified version of the text in Russian—do not include explanations, comments, or introductory phrases.\n\nText to simplify:\n\"\"\"\n{clipboard_text}\n\"\"\""
